# Go-HashMap
A simple hashmap implementation written in Go. Written for educational purpose, but still useable nonetheless. It uses the FNV-1a hash function for faster and more well distributed hashes than the more traditional polynmial hashes. It uses bitwise operators to derive bucket indexes which is more efficient than division operations like modulo.
